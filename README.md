Azure Static Web App Redirects in Gatsby
---

If you want to host your Gatsby output with an [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/), you can use a [routes.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/routes) file to have redirects processed server side. This plugin builds that file for you.

## Thanks

This plugin is based on [gatsby-plugin-htaccess-redirects](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-plugin-htaccess-redirects) by **Gatsby Central**.
